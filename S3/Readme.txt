In this code, we first set up our AWS credentials and region using environment variables. We also specify the local directory where the files are located, and the name of the S3 bucket we want to upload them to.

We then create an S3 client using the boto3 library, and use the os module to get a list of files in the local directory.

Finally, we loop through the files and use a subprocess call to run the aws s3 cp command to upload each file to the S3 bucket. The subprocess call takes a list of arguments, which in this case includes the AWS CLI command (aws), the S3 subcommand (s3), the source file path (local_file_path), and the destination S3 file path (s3://{bucket_name}/{s3_file_key}).
