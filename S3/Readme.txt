In this code, we first set up our AWS credentials and region using environment variables. We also specify the local directory where the files are located, and the name of the S3 bucket we want to upload them to.

We then create an S3 client using the boto3 library, and use the os module to get a list of files in the local directory.

Finally, we loop through the files and use a subprocess call to run the aws s3 cp command to upload each file to the S3 bucket. The subprocess call takes a list of arguments, which in this case includes the AWS CLI command (aws), the S3 subcommand (s3), the source file path (local_file_path), and the destination S3 file path (s3://{bucket_name}/{s3_file_key}).

In proc.py,

Python code to move files to S3 bucket.

Please write some example python code that uses a proc user to move multiple files from a local directory to an s3 bucket

Sure! Here is an example Python code that uses the boto3 library to move multiple files from a local directory to an S3 bucket using a subprocess call:

python
Copy code
import os
import subprocess
import boto3

# Set up AWS credentials and region
os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = 'your_access_key_id'
os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = 'your_secret_access_key'
os.environ['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'] = 'your_aws_region'

# Set up local directory and S3 bucket name
local_dir = '/path/to/local/directory'
bucket_name = 'your_s3_bucket_name'

# Create S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# Get list of files in local directory
files = os.listdir(local_dir)

# Loop through files and upload to S3 bucket
for file in files:
    local_file_path = os.path.join(local_dir, file)
    s3_file_key = file
    subprocess.call(['aws', 's3', 'cp', local_file_path, f's3://{bucket_name}/{s3_file_key}'])
In this code, we first set up our AWS credentials and region using environment variables. We also specify the local directory where the files are located, and the name of the S3 bucket we want to upload them to.

We then create an S3 client using the boto3 library, and use the os module to get a list of files in the local directory.

Finally, we loop through the files and use a subprocess call to run the aws s3 cp command to upload each file to the S3 bucket. The subprocess call takes a list of arguments, which in this case includes the AWS CLI command (aws), the S3 subcommand (s3), the source file path (local_file_path), and the destination S3 file path (s3://{bucket_name}/{s3_file_key}).

Write some example python code that allows a configured proc user to access an s3 bucket

Certainly! Here's an example Python code that demonstrates how to configure AWS credentials for a proc user to access an S3 bucket using the boto3 library:

python
Copy code
import boto3
from botocore.config import Config

# Set up the proc user's AWS access key ID and secret access key
aws_access_key_id = 'your_proc_user_access_key_id'
aws_secret_access_key = 'your_proc_user_secret_access_key'

# Set up the AWS session with the proc user's credentials and a custom configuration
config = Config(
    retries = {
        'max_attempts': 10,
        'mode': 'standard'
    }
)
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id,
    aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key,
    config=config
)

# Create an S3 client using the configured session
s3 = session.client('s3')

# Access the S3 bucket using the S3 client
bucket_name = 'your_s3_bucket_name'
response = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)

# Process the response as needed
for obj in response['Contents']:
    print(obj['Key'])
In this example, we first set up the proc user's AWS access key ID and secret access key as Python variables.

We then create an AWS session with these credentials and a custom configuration using the boto3 library. The Config object allows us to customize settings like the number of retries and the retry mode for AWS requests.

We use the configured session to create an S3 client and access the S3 bucket by listing the objects in the bucket. The response is stored in the response variable, which we can then process as needed.

Note that the proc user must have the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket, which can be granted using AWS IAM policies.
