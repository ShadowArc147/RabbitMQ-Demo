This YAML file deploys a RabbitMQ service as a Kubernetes deployment with a single replica. The service provides two ports, one for AMQP and one for the management interface. The RabbitMQ image used is rabbitmq:3.8.16-management-alpine, which includes the management plugin and is based on the Alpine Linux distribution to minimize the image size. The deployment specifies environment variables for the RabbitMQ username and password, and mounts an empty directory as a volume for persistent data storage.
